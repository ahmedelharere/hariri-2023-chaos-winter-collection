# Hariri Collection – 2023

## 🧵 Chaos (Fawda) Collection

> “The idea comes from the urge to find peace. That’s what the pigeon symbolizes — peace. But sometimes, to grow, you need to disrupt, challenge yourself, and embrace the chaos — ‘Fawda’ in Arabic. Just don’t forget this one thing: If you can see it, you can have it.”  
> — *Ahmed M. Elharere*

The Hariri 2023 Collection is a bold narrative of balance between stillness and disruption.  
Each piece is a call to **challenge comfort**, **break norms**, and embrace your vision.
