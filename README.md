## 🧵 Chaos (Fawda) Collection

> “The Story Behind This Design
The Idea of this one comes from the urge to find peace, that is what the pigeon means for all of us (peace), but we believe that you sometimes have to make a move, challenge yourself, leave your comfort zone, and havoc chaos, or as what is called in Arabic, Fawda. Yet, do not forget that one thing, you can! If you can see it, you can have it.”  
> — *Ahmed M. Elharere*

The Hariri 2023 Collection is a bold narrative of balance between stillness and disruption.  
Each piece is a call to **challenge comfort**, **break norms**, and embrace your vision.
